1- Filtered raw json data to get description from bank statements

2- Hand coded the algorithm to extract categories from description

3- Converted the extracted categories along with description and saved in csv format for model training

4-
  Vectorizer Used --> **CountVectorizer**
  Model Used --> **MultinomialNB**
  *Both are used from sklearn library*

5- Used sklearn train_test_split for splitting test and train sets

6- Saved trained model for use

7- Tested
